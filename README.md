# AI-JARVIS-VOICE-ASISTANT
Jarvis or J.A.R.V.I.S. is an artificial intelligence computer system which assists the Iron Man i.e. Tony Stark. J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just a Rather Very Intelligent System) was also introduced in the comic books as the program that helps operate Pepper Potts’ Rescue suit. Jarvis software is a very intelligent A.I. who can respond according to the users thoughts.

## Demo
Link: [https://ipl-prediciton-1.herokuapp.com/](https://ipl-prediciton-1.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview
This is a Flask web app and it has 2 functionalities.
1) **Predicts the innings Score**
2) **Predicts the winner of the match**


## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.9.2 If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployement on Heroku
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.

Our next step would be to follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.

## Bug / Feature Request

• If you find a bug (the website couldn't handle the query and / or gave undesired results), kindly open an [issue](https://github.com/SuryanshNaugraiya/IPL/issues) here by including your search query and the expected result.<br />
• If you encounter this webapp as shown in the picture given below, it is occuring just because **free dynos for this particular month provided by Heroku have been completely used.** _You can access the webpage on 1st of the next month._<br />
• Sorry for the inconvenience.
